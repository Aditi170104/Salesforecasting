This project analyzes Walmart sales data by performing time series decomposition to extract trend, seasonality, and residuals. It then applies an ARIMA model to forecast future sales. Key features include:

Data Preprocessing: Converts dates and aggregates weekly sales into monthly sales.
Time Series Decomposition: Splits sales data into trend, seasonal, and residual components for better insights.
Forecasting with ARIMA: Predicts sales for the next 12 months using the ARIMA model.
Residual Analysis: Evaluates model accuracy with residual mean, standard deviation, and autocorrelation.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels
ðŸ”¹ Usage: Run the script to visualize sales trends and predict future sales.
